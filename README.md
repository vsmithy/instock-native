## Status

## Upcoming Major Changes!!
* I have decided to do a complete rewrite, removing Expo (although I did like it!).
* I am redoing a large part of the UI with only Android in mind because designing for a mix of IOS and Android left me not liking any of the design.
* I am adding the ability to link app with other friends/family/roomates.
